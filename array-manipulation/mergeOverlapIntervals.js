// Q. Merge Overlapping Intervals
/**
 * Given a list of intervals, merge them to get a list of non-overlapping intervals.

intervali = [starti, endi]

Example:
Intervals: [[1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 4], [5, 6]]

[1, 2] and [2, 3] can be merged to form [1, 3].
Now, [1, 3] and [1, 4] can be merged to form [1, 4].
[1, 4] and [5, 6] have no intersection.
Hence above intervals are merged to form:
[[1, 4], [5, 6]]

Note that the final list should be in ascending order.
