/** Q.  Next Greater Permutation
 * Given an array, rearrange it to its next greater permutation.
 * Do it in-place with extra constant memory only. 
 * Do not use any library function for the next permutation.
 * 
 * Example: Array: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Next Greater Permutation: [1, 2, 4, 3]
Next Greater Permutation: [1, 3, 2, 4]
Next Greater Permutation: [1, 3, 4, 2]
Next Greater Permutation: [1, 4, 2, 3]
Next Greater Permutation: [1, 4, 3, 2]
Next Greater Permutation: [2, 1, 3, 4]
